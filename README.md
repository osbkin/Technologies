Welcome to the Technologies app! It's your handy tool for diving into Apple's amazing technology.

## Key Features:

- **Easy to Use:** Explore Apple Tech is built with simplicity in mind. It uses SwiftUI and MVVM architecture, so it's organized and easy to understand. Whether you're a tech newbie or a pro, you'll find everything straightforward.
